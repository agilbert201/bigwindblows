Okay, Elon Musk has a much better resume than I do. He has a boat load more money. He is probably smarter. He is almost certainly having a lot more fun. And is taking a lot more risk. I give him my full congratulations. And yes, Tesla's sure seem cool. But then I will never really probably ride in one let alone drive one, so my admiration is a bit tempered.

More generally perhaps a little reality check is in order. A lot of successful people and heros are after all just sometimes a little fortunate. Right time right place. And despite their seemingly near-super human powers, still are homo sapiens, still have some flaws, make some mistakes. I assume Musk is one of us, but then who knows, given the obsession with flying to Mars.

It might seem silly to point this all out. But given the trendy worhship tweets and articles burning up the Internet, see [The Shared Genuis of Elon Musk and Steve Jobs](http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/21/leadership/steve-jobs-elon-musk.pr.fortune/), one might ponder. And judging by the ultra-cool hipster status of those fortunate enough to get a shiny new Tesla and drive it around the cool haunts of SF and NYC, he is sort of channeling the design / demand magic of Jobs I guess. But dang, can we put just a little perspective on things?

## The Telsa is Not an iPhone

If it were it would be genius

Sure Jobs and Musk share some superficial traits. Sure it is easy to want to draw the analogies. But there are limits to where this all leads. In a rare foray onto Facebook recently I had someone fortunate enough to be getting a Tesla ranting on about how it is like the "next iPhone" and is going to "change the world". Hmm. Perhaps there is a reason I don't go on Facebook that much I thought.

More seriosuly, last I checked a Tesla still costs about a bizzillion more $$ than an iPhone. Not thinking "everyone is gonna have one soon". More worrisome, last I checked, is a Tesla is about a bizzillion more $$ even than a normal car. Least it might as well be. For normal people, whatever that means. The important point is I don't think "everyone is gonna have one soon". And this is one of the first big problems. Great that there is some segment of the world that can acutally buy these things. But wow. Any idea how out of the ballpark this is for average Joe? You get the depressing sense that one segment of people, those that can buy a Tesla, doesn't hang out very much with the rest of us. Or at least doesn't really fathom our financial realities.

The beauty, genius if one must, of Jobs and the iPhone was precisely that it scaled so massively. The technology wasn't technically revolutionary. Phones, email, touch screens all existed. The design, packaging and execution were outstanding. Most important, the marginal switching costs were entirely within the bounds of imagination. Even the lowliest of low flip phone BlackBerry wannabe loser could dream about going to the big leagues, blowing right by their used to be cool friends, co-workers and spouses and diving right into iPhone uber coolness land. 

This isn't ever gonna happen with the Tesla roadster. The day I see them parked outside the local Meth clinic I will eat my words. Until then, you can be almost certain the kids inside in the waiting room are staring at their iPhone screens. And as messed up as that is, it ain't nearly as messed up as seeing Telsa's in the lot would be.

In Musk's defense, I realize there is a plan. Start with the fancy sports car, then evolve into the affordable version for the plebes. But try to be at least a little skeptical here. Is it not at least slimly possible that the genuis of Musk is to realize making an electric car that is workable and appealable is uber $$$? And thus you really need to go up market, appeal to manhood, power and a dose of guilty green relief? Target the movie stars, VC's, Internet wunderchildren and the rest of the "I am not a 1%", 1% crowd? Brilliant! And then you just keep selling about how great phase II and III are going to be for everyone else, someday? But here is the real ass kicker to that narrative. If you follow the skeptical train of thought just a little you start to ponder the next question. What's the real math here? If the problem is going green, at a macro level, how much impact is Tesla really having?

## Cool Shiny Things are Not the Only Answer

And sometimes they might not be the best one.
Or even a good one.

With all respect to Musk and Tesla, in the psychology, economics and politics of going green, conservation and efficiency seem to become step children of innovation and cool new things. Think Jimmy Carter and the sweater. Ouch.Unfortunate, but nothing new here. But that doesn't mean, objectively speaking, that a cool shiny Tesla is really the best path to green bliss. The math demands some attention. 

Best I can tell given my time for the research is there are maybe 40K Tesla cars out there. Maybe a capacity to push that many in 2014.

The problem is if you compare not just Tesla, but all pure electric plugins, against the fleet wide mariginal improvements being made through mundane thinks like improved aero dynamics, weight reduction and powerplant tuning, the overall benefits of incremental improvements are vastly more massive.

SkyActive, Hybrids, Diesels - millions of units. Mazda alone exceeding 1.5M for 2014.

avgMiles * baseline - savingsMPG * units = X
avgMiles * baseline - (baseline - equivalent) * teslaunits = Y

And the answer is, Telsa is getting it's ass kicked. It lacks numbers. Badly. And that is the rub, in the game of having true impact in going green, the answer is not in shiny cool things that don't scale. Today. Not promises for tomorrow.

## SpaceX is Not Outpeforming Space Programs

It is leveraging them, their R&D legacy, their expertise. And it is playing by a different set of rules.

## Manned Space Travel Is STUPID

Too $$
Hard to justify science wise
The true "revolution" would be go completely give up on the "macho" aspect, and embrace the "drone" revolution fully. 

## Recurring Billing Scams are Great For Musk, Bad For You

Solar City
Many homeowners better of with incremental investments in Energy Star appliances, windows, insulation. Direct benefit to them, scales, incentives aligned.
